## About Insurance Data set
This dataset contains detailed information about insurance customers, including their age, sex, body mass index (BMI), number of children, smoking status and region. Having access to such valuable insights allows analysts to get a better view into customer behaviour and the factors that contribute to their insurance charges. By understanding the patterns in this data set we can gain useful insight into how age,gender and lifestyle choices can affect a person's insurance premiums. This could be of great value when setting up an insurance plan or marketing campaigns that target certain demographics. Furthermore, this dataset provides us with an opportunity to explore deeper questions such as what are some possible solutions for increasing affordability when it comes to dealing with high charges for certain groups?
